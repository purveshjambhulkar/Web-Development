What is an ID?
An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one
HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling
and JavaScript manipulations
ID Selector: To target an element by its ID, use '#' followed by the ID name in CSS.

What are Classes?
The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements.
That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once. Classes are not
unique and can be assigned to multiple elements. They are generally used for applying
the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements.
Class Selector: To target elements by their class, use '.' followed by the class name in CSS.
