HTML entities are special characters represented by specific codes or names that aren't directly typable on a keyboard.

Named Entities: Represented by their name preceded by an ampersand (&) and followed by a semicolon (;). For example:

&nbsp;: Non-breaking space.
&copy;: Copyright symbol.
&lt;: Less than symbol (<).
&gt;: Greater than symbol (>).


Decimal Entities: Represented by a hash (#) followed by the decimal Unicode value of the character and ending with a semicolon. For example:

&#169;: Copyright symbol (&copy;)


Hexadecimal Entities: Represented by #x followed by the hexadecimal Unicode value and ending with a semicolon. For example:

&#x00A9;: Copyright symbol (&copy;).


Common Examples:
Non-breaking space: &nbsp;
Trademark symbol: &trade; or &#8482;
Euro currency symbol: &euro; or &#8364;
Em dash: &mdash; or &#8212;
Registered trademark symbol: &reg; or &#174;

The <pre> tag in HTML stands for "preformatted text." 
It's used to display text exactly as it's written in the HTML code, 
preserving spaces, line breaks, and formatting.
