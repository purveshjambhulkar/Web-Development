Components of the Box Model:
Content: The actual content area where text, images, or other media are displayed.

Padding: Space between the content and the element's border. It helps to create space within the element.

Border: The boundary surrounding the padding. It outlines the element's width and style.

Margin: Space outside the border, creating separation between elements.

MARGIN COLLASPE(when the margin of two elements collaspe the margin which is big is given betweem the two elemets)

Margin collapsing is a behavior in CSS where the vertical margins between adjacent elements collapse, resulting in a smaller margin between them than expected. 

Adjacent Vertical Margins: When two or more block-level elements are stacked vertically, their top and bottom margins might collapse into a single margin.

Collapsing Rules:
Only vertical margins collapse.
Collapsing occurs between block-level elements in the normal flow of the document.

<div class="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
<div class="sibling"></div>


.parent {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
.child {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}
.sibling {
  margin-top: 25px;
}


In this case, the margin between .parent and .sibling might collapse to 30px instead of being 45px as expected due to margin collapsing between the .parent and .child elements.
